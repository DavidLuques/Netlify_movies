I have developed this project using HTML5, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

  ## How to run

  Before using the application, you need to register and select a fictitious payment method.
  Remember to meet the password requirements, or a custom error will let you know what's missing.

## Roadmap

- JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling

- Use of Local Storage for user session control and preferences storage

- Pure CSS usage

- Responsive web design
